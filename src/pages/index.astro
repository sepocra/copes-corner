What I notice
</h1>
			<p>
			I spend a lot of time noticing how things really work —
in workplaces, on basketball courts, at home with kids, and in the routines that shape our days.
This is where I put those observations.<br>
<br>
Part reflection, part sense-making.<br>
Somewhere to pause, notice, and make sense of what’s actually going on <br>
